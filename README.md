# DevConnect
Following along with Traversy Media's course, (MERN Stack Front to Back)[https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/] on Udemy.

Practicing the MERN stack before branching out to fullstack projects of my own.

This is a bit bigger than a typical course project, and ties together:
- Node.js / Express
- MongoDB
- React and Redux
- Bootstrap
- Heroku and Git for deployment
